#CapitalOne Hackathon - CapitalHack App

Problem statement: Many of us are visually minded people but our banking apps don’t allow us to easily visualize and understand where our money is going and how we could better utilize it. 

Solution: We want to create a banking and financial literacy app that will allow users to input the monetary amount and type of their purchases which will then be stored in the app. The app will display graphs in real-time that show the necessity of their purchases and will use set criteria to determine what percentage of money the user could possibly save. The user can also set their own criteria and goals that will be used to alter these amounts. The app would also use these user-inputted goals to remind the user of meeting certain monetary amounts for a specific time period. 

Benefits: This is a good idea because many banking apps don’t inform the user of where their money is going and therefore increase financial illiteracy.
