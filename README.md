# **CapitalOne Hackathon - CapitalHack App**

Problem statement: Many of us are visually minded people but our banking apps donâ€™t allow us to easily visualize and understand where our money is going and how we could better utilize it.

Solution: We want to create a banking and financial literacy app that will allow users to input the monetary amount and type of their purchases which will then be stored in the app. The app will display graphs in real-time that show the necessity of their purchases and will use set criteria to determine what percentage of money the user could possibly save. The user can also set their own criteria and goals that will be used to alter these amounts. The app would also use these user-inputted goals to remind the user of meeting certain monetary amounts for a specific time period. 

Benefits: Modern banking helps consumers by consolidating funds and debt, but doesn't increase financial literacy or give consumers the tools to be smart with their money. Our hackathon project directly addresses this gap. Equiping consumers with this knowledge, provided only by Capital One, would increase client-consumer relations and retain consumers because of the trusting nature consumers will feel when they think of Capital One. Not only this, but this app can help equalize the gap in financial knowledge experienced by marginalized communities, often on the lower side of the socioeconomic totem poll.
